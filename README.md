# Bootcamp-Assignment-3


This project is Asssignment 3 for the OSU Bootcamp. The goal of the project was to make a working random password generator that took several prompts from the user and returned a password that match the selected criteria. This projected utilized Javascript and provided practice with <b>declaring variables, if..else statements, for loops, and functions<b>. 
  
  The password generator had to satisfy the followsing requirements:
  
  GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
